# Musician

This is a side project outside of the course content of Code Institute. I created this website for freelance musicians to use to help boost their online presence and help them get in touch with potential clients or event organisers.


## Technologies used

I built this website from scratch with CSS, HTML, and Boostrap. I designed the website first with Figma.

The Figma project can be viewed here:
